## 🚀 What Is This Mod?

Building large factories in **Create** is fun, but placing long fluid pipe routes block by block can get repetitive fast.

**Create: Pipe Connector** lets you plan a pipe route, preview it, and place the whole line at once. It is designed to make pipe building faster while still giving you control over the final path.

---

## ✨ Main Features

- **Automatic Pipe Routing:** Quickly connect Create fluid pipes through a valid path.
- **Smart Pathfinding:** Routes around obstacles when possible.
- **Live Ghost Preview:** See where pipes will be placed before confirming.
- **Anchor Waypoints:** Press `C` to force the route through a point.
- **Undo Last Anchor:** Press `V` to remove the last anchor.
- **Preview Lock:** Press `Left Alt` to freeze/unfreeze the current preview target.
- **Survival Friendly:** Shows `required/available` pipes and blocks placement if you do not have enough.
- **Configurable Controls:** Rebind connector keys from Minecraft's Controls menu.
- **Create Integration:** Refreshes Create pipe networks after placement.

---

## 📦 Supported Pipes

- `create:fluid_pipe`
- `create:smart_fluid_pipe`

---

## 🎮 How To Use

1. Put a supported Create pipe in your **off-hand**.
2. Keep your **main hand empty**.
3. Sneak + right-click to start the connection.
4. Move your crosshair to preview the route.
5. Optional: press `C` to add an anchor.
6. Optional: press `V` to remove the last anchor.
7. Optional: press `Left Alt` to lock/unlock the preview target.
8. Sneak + right-click again to place the planned pipe line.

In survival, the action bar shows:

```txt
required/available
```

Example:

```txt
10/32
```

If you do not have enough pipes, the required number turns red and placement is cancelled.

## 💻 For Developers

> This branch is **NeoForge-only**. Shared placement logic lives in `common`, while the active runtime implementation lives in `neoforge`.

### Project Structure

- **Core Logic (`/common`):**
  Shared backend logic lives in `common/src/main/java/com/javiluli/createpipeconnector/connector/PipeConnectorLogic.java`.

- **NeoForge Implementation (`/neoforge`):**
  Handles entrypoints, events, networking, keybinds, server-side placement, and client preview rendering.

- **Rendering (`/neoforge/.../client/render`):**
  The ghost preview system is managed by `PipeGhostRenderer.java`, with anchor highlights in the `overlay` package.

### Building

- Run the NeoForge dev client: `./gradlew :neoforge:runClient`
- Build the NeoForge artifact: `./gradlew :neoforge:build`
- Build and copy the release jar: `./gradlew buildAll`

### Documentation

- `docs/PLAYER_GUIDE.md` - In-depth player usage
- `docs/MODPACK_GUIDE.md` - Packmaker notes and integration
